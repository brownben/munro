          Munro was created by Ben Brown for his Advanced Higher Computing Project, as a calculator of the orienteering league standings. It is designed to be fast and easy to use, offering sorting and filtering on the results. It also has easy upload supporting various upload formats to make the upload as quick and easy as possible for event organisers.
