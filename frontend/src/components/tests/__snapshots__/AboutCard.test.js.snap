      Munro is a league results calculator, originally created as part of my
      Advanced Higher Computing Project. It calculates the overall results for
      a series of events, it is designed to be easy to use and require very
      little effort for league coordinators and event organisers to use.

      Munro allows you to see all the information for a league on one place,
      and provides multiple options to sort and filter results so you can view
      the results in whatever form you want. It also supports multiple file
      formats for upload and several different scoring systems, making the
      process as quick and stress free as possible for event organisers.
